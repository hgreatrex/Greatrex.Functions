# Greatrex.Functions

The goal of Greatrex.Functions is to collate functions I find useful or
that underpin many of my scripts. These might be tiny things from stack
overflow answers, little ways to make coding easier, or weird custom
functions that only get used by me in specific ways

## Installation

You can install the development version of Greatrex.Functions like so:

``` r
 #install.packages(remotes)  # As needed
 remotes::install_github('hgreatrex/Greatrex.Functions',force=TRUE)
```

## What functions are there?

Letâ€™s just list them for now. More to come

``` r
library(Greatrex.Functions)
ls("package:Greatrex.Functions")
#> [1] "conditionalcreate"     "makedates"             "palettemaker"         
#> [4] "rasterstack_mean_fast"
```
